Olivier FAURE: One of the articles I'd like to write is about the current state of the Rust GUI ecosystem.

Olivier FAURE: Two themes in particular:

    Code-sharing between projects (there is much more than 2 years ago).
    Which projects are funded by whom.

Olivier FAURE: Re: the first subject, we'll need to wait until our direction with winit is fully settled (though I think we're pretty much there?).

The article would talk about:

- Embark funding winit and rust-gpu.
- Google Fonts funding us.
- System76 funding iced and COSMIC-Text.
- Futurewei funding Dioxus, Makepad, and Servo.
- Igalia funding Servo (I think).

Any I forgot?
```

I'd just add a note that winit is not funded by anyone and it's not an open collective/etc. Maybe rust-mobile stuff is funded by Embark, but main winit runs by people in their free time without any financial/hardware/etc aid.

There is funding going around in the Bevy ecosystem - https://bevyengine.org/sponsorship-pledge/
