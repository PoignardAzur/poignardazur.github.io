  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    My name is Olivier Faure, also known as PoignardAzur and various other pseudonyms. I think this is my 4th attempt at making a blog, the pivotal difference being that I have things to say this time.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a professional developer who dabbles in a bit of everything, although these days I've evolved from a C++ enthusiast into a Rust enthusiast. My focus is mostly on desktop apps, though I've done some frontend and backend work as well.
