# Hire me

Have you seen something you like on this site? Do you have a project you'd like to work on together? I'm available for hire as a freelance developer at [olivier.cj.faure@gmail.com](mailto:olivier.cj.faure@gmail.com).

I'm a generalist, but I have a particular interest in UI/UX and tooling improvements. The missions I can do for you include:

- **Short-term web development** I can provide you an off-the-shelf website, or fix a problem on your existing website. I have a preference for low-tech solutions, and I can provide you with a lightweight site with low maintenance, strong accessibility metrics and good technical SEO.
- **Rust development** I have extensive knowledge of the Rust ecosystem thanks to my work on Druid, Panoramix, Venial and Masonry. I kickstart a Rust project or join an existing team, create a codebase from scratch or help migrate an existing codebase.
- **WebAssembly development** I have two professional experiences in WebAssembly and have been following the space since its inception. I can help you migrate your codebase from C to wasm and address the DX challenges that ensue.
- **Embedded development** I'm interested in microcontroller and FPGA development.

My preferred technology is Rust, but I have extensive experience in C, C++, Node.js and Python; of course, given time I can adapt to any tech stack you are using.

I can integrate within one of your teams or work on my own on an objective we agree on. I'm available for in-person work in the Paris area and for remote work anywhere. My timezone is GMT+1 (Paris).
