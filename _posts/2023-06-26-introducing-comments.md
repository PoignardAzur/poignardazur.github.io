title: Your blog, now with comments!
---

This blog now uses [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/) to implement comments.

Actually, this post right here is for me to test them, and see how they look. But hopefully I'll keep them!

Some articles (eg the [Learning to swim](/2023/06/23/learning-to-swim) essay) don't have a subreddit I can point to for comments (and reddit's future is somewhat uncertain right now anyway). So having a drop-in script for implementing comment, using the platform this blog is already based on (Github) feels like an easy win.

By the way, did you know this blog has a RSS feed, and has had it ever since its creation? Make sure to subscribe! Or don't. It's not like I track these statistics anyway.

Anyway, have fun, bye.
