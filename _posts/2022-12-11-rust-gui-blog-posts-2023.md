title: A call for blogs about Rust GUI in 2023
---

This is a call for everyone in [the Rust programming language's](https://www.rust-lang.org/) community:

**Let's talk about GUI!**

GUI in Rust is what you might call a "work in progress". [We are not GUI yet](https://www.areweguiyet.com/), unfortunately, despite the best efforts of everybody involved.

Still! There has been a lot of progress in the last few years, but discussion about it has been rare and scattered. As the end of the year approaches, I though I could take a page [from the Rust blog](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/10/29/A-call-for-blogs-2020.html) and send a call for blog posts about Rust GUI.

- To GUI framework maintainers:
  - What are you working on?
  - How much progress are you making?
  - What do you hope your project will look like at the end of 2023?

- To GUI users:
  - What are you using?
  - What are your pain points?
  - What do you think is missing from the Rust GUI ecosystem overall?
  - What would you really like to happen next year?

I hope to see a lot of discussions flourish, and maybe people will learn about projects or tools they weren't aware of.

If there's enough buy-in, I'll write a summary of the posts I saw, to be published mid-january.

So get writing, and happy holidays to you all!
